# MovieWebApp
This project will be at the end a web application in which you can register and add watched movies, you will also be able to rate these movies and commpare your
rating with ratings from thousands of users. This website is done to be used by groups of friends that want to share movies they watched and also provide ratings to their friends.

# Technologies
Other than making an interesting project for me, this project will help me to familiarize myself with React, but also back end technologies such as Node.JS and 
MongoDB. I will also learn how to communicate with API's since in this project, I will be using the TMDB API to retrieve data on the movies.
