# MovieWebApp
This project will be at the end a web application in which you can register and add watched movies, you will also be able to rate these movies and commpare your
rating with ratings from thousands of users.

# Technologies
Other than making an interesting project for me, this project will help me to familiarize myself with React, but also back end technologies such as Node.JS and 
MongoDB. I will also learn how to communicate with API's since in this project, I will be using the TMDB API to retrieve data on the movies.

# How to run the project:
More to come soon...

# The project in images (still in development...)
This is the first page when you arrive on the website, here I added a few movies to test how they fill the page

The format should look like that, we can't have more than 3 movies on a row, they will arrange themselves automatically
